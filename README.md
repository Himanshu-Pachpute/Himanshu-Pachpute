## Overview

I specialize in CAD customization and automation, primarily working with Creo Parametric and ProToolkit. My work focuses on solving geometry-heavy problems, writing clean C++ code, and turning complex engineering workflows into structured automation systems that save engineering teams significant time.

If it saves engineers hours of manual effort, I'm interested.
