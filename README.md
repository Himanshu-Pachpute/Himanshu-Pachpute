## Mechanical Engineer | CAD Automation Engineer | Creo Customization | C++ Developer

I build automation solutions inside Creo that eliminate repetitive design work and enforce engineering logic at scale.

Currently at **SLB**, previously at **Tata Technologies (onsite at Tata Motors)**, working on CAD customization(Creo) and ProToolkit based applications.

I enjoy solving geometry heavy problems, writing clean C++ code, and turning complex engineering workflows into structured automation systems.
